          <p className='mb-3 '>Ski jumping, a thrilling winter sport that combines grace, skill, and courage, has a rich history dating back centuries. Its origins can be traced back to the rugged terrains of Norway and Sweden, where it was initially used as a mode of transportation during harsh winters. Early forms of ski jumping involved individuals propelling themselves over natural obstacles such as rocks and cliffs, often for practical purposes rather than sport.</p>

          <p className='mb-3 '>One of the earliest documented ski jumping events occurred in Trysil, Norway, in 1862, where participants competed for both distance and style. As the sport gained popularity, ski jumping hills were purposefully constructed, allowing athletes to showcase their skills in front of larger audiences.</p>

          <p className='mb-3 '>Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ski jumping continued to evolve, with athletes pushing the boundaries of distance and technique. The introduction of specialized equipment, such as aerodynamic ski suits and more streamlined skis, contributed to record-breaking performances and the advancement of the sport.</p>

          <p className='mb-3 '>Ski jumping gained international recognition with its inclusion in the inaugural Winter Olympics held in Chamonix, France, in 1924. Since then, it has remained a staple of the Winter Games, captivating audiences with its breathtaking displays of athleticism and precision.</p>

          <p className='mb-3 '>Over the decades, ski jumping has seen numerous innovations and refinements, including changes to equipment, technique, and competition formats. Today, the sport is governed by the International Ski Federation (FIS), which oversees regulations and ensures fair play across all levels of competition.</p>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-8">
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>In-run:</strong> Athletes begin their jump from a designated starting point, known as the in-run. The in-run typically consists of a steep slope that allows skiers to build momentum before takeoff.</li>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Takeoff:</strong> Skiers launch themselves into the air from a curved ramp known as the takeoff. Proper technique during takeoff is crucial for achieving maximum distance and maintaining stability in flight.</li>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Flight:</strong> Once airborne, skiers adopt a streamlined aerodynamic position to minimize air resistance and maximize distance. Judges evaluate the athlete's posture and technique during flight, awarding points for style and form.</li>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Landing:</strong> A successful jump culminates with a smooth landing on the hill's slope. Skiers aim to land with stability and grace, maintaining control throughout the descent.</li>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Scoring:</strong> Distance is the primary factor in determining a skier's score, with longer jumps receiving higher marks. Judges also assess the athlete's style and execution, awarding additional points for elegance and control.</li>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety measures, including hill design, equipment regulations, and medical personnel on standby, are paramount in ski jumping to prevent injuries and ensure the well-being of athletes.</li>
